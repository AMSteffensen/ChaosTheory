# Concept (Elevator pitch)
Imagine a puzzle game where the player meets  his own psychology. Where the player himself plays his mind in the future, playing the game in the present ( Think Chaos Theory).

The mind works with images, visual representations of the things we have perceived. 

The game is  about fractal art that reacts on interactivity by the player. The player can change variables inside the game, and make his own fractals. 

It is basically a fractal art simulator and builder, where you make your own reality. 

Only the reality is already your own reality.
